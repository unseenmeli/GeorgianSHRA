This condition occurs in individuals with a male chromosome pattern (46,XY) and leads to the development of female physical traits despite the presence of male genetic makeup. This condition arises from genetic mutations that impair the function of androgen receptors. Although the body produces normal or even elevated levels of androgens, the cells fail to recognize these signals, leading to incomplete or absent male physical development.",

Although the body produces normal or even elevated levels of androgens, the cells fail to recognize these signals, leading to incomplete or absent male physical development.",
            "ForP1Paragraph2": "Forms of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome AIS is classified into three forms based on the severity of androgen resistance: Complete AIS (CAIS): Individuals have a fully feminine appearance, including well-developed breasts and female external genitalia. However, they lack internal female reproductive organs, such as the uterus and ovaries. Testes are present but are usually located in the abdomen or groin. These individuals are typically raised as females and have a female gender identity. Partial AIS (PAIS): Individuals may have a mix of male and female physical traits, with varying degrees of genital development. Mild AIS (MAIS): Individuals appear male but may experience reduced fertility or other subtle symptoms. Diagnosis and Management: Diagnosis of AIS frequently occurs during childhood or adolescence. Common triggers for investigation include undescended testes in infancy or the absence of menstruation (amenorrhea) during puberty. Advanced genetic testing and hormone analysis are critical tools for confirming AIS. Management of AIS is tailored to each individual’s needs, focusing on both physical and emotional well-being. Key aspects include: Surgical Intervention: In CAIS, undescended testes are often removed after puberty to reduce the risk of malignancy, as the likelihood of testicular cancer increases with age. Hormone Replacement Therapy: Following gonad removal, estrogen therapy is introduced to maintain feminine characteristics and protect against complications like osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Psychological Support: A diagnosis of AIS can be life-altering. Psychological counseling and support groups play a vital role in helping individuals and their families navigate questions of identity and health.",
            "ForP1Paragraph3": "Long-Term Considerations Early diagnosis is essential to reduce cancer risks and provide appropriate medical care. A multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including endocrinologists, surgeons, psychologists, and genetic counselors, works to support both the individual and their family. This comprehensive approach ensures that individuals with AIS can lead fulfilling lives. Understanding conditions like AIS not only enhances medical knowledge but also challenges societal norms about gender and identity.

All women with RPL should have an assessment of the uterine anatomy. If a M\u00fcllerian uterine malformation is diagnosed, further investigations (including investigation of the kidneys and urinary tract) should be considered. Acquired uterine malformations (submucous myomas, endometrial polyps, and uterine adhesions) have been found prevalent in women that suffered pregnancy loss, but the clinical relevance is unclear. Endocrine factors: Polycystic ovary syndrome. Lutein deficiency (inadequate progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum). Hyperprolactinemia (elevated blood prolactin levels). Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid screening (TSH and TPO antibodies) is recommended in women with RPL. Abnormal TSH levels should be followed up by T4 testing in women with RPL. Endometriosis (recent studies indicate progesterone resistance in endometriosis patients). Disruptions in maternal-fetal microcirculation and the development of systemic thrombosis have been identified as major contributors to RPL. Thrombophilia and Recurrent Pregnancy Loss. Thrombophilia is a hereditary or acquired condition that predisposes women with RPL to venous thromboembolism (i.e., venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). Acquired Thrombophilia: The most common form of acquired thrombophilia is antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by specific clinical and laboratory findings. In APS, pregnancy loss is primarily due to thrombosis within the maternal-fetal circulatory system. Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome requires the assessment of antiphospholipid antibodies, including: \u2022 Lupus anticoagulant (LA) \u2022 Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA IgG/IgM) \u2022 Anti-beta2-glycoprotein antibodies (a\u03b22GPI)",
            "ForP4Paragraph3": "Genetic thrombophilia is an inherited pathological condition that predisposes to the development of thrombosis, which is manifested by obstetric complications. Hereditary thrombophilia is considered a possible cause of recurrent miscarriage and late pregnancy complications with a probable mechanism of thrombosis development in the uterine-placental circulation. It has been considered that hypercoagulable state of pregnancy and the likelihood of developing thrombosis in the maternal and fetal circulatory system are often due to polymorphism of various genes of thrombophilia. In the early stages of pregnancy, including in the preimplantation period, development of pregnancy loss is facilitated due to the disruption of blood flow in the endometrial blood vessels through implantation disorders, and in the late term promotes development of complications such as preeclampsia (PE), preterm labor (PTL), and preterm placental abruption. According to evidence-based medicine, specific genetic thrombophilias are associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic and obstetric complications, including: Antithrombin III deficiency, Protein C and Protein S deficiency, Prothrombin (F2) G20210A mutation, Factor V Leiden mutation, PAI-1 (-675 5G/4G) polymorphism, MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms. Current guidelines from RCOG, ASRM, and ESHRE recommend screening for thrombophilia gene mutations only in women with RPL who also have a personal or family history of thrombosis. In cases of acquired and/or hereditary thrombophilia, aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are commonly considered for treatment. Hyperhomocysteinemia and Pregnancy Loss: Recent studies suggest that hyperhomocysteinemia (elevated homocysteine levels in the blood) may contribute to pregnancy loss. Infectious Causes of Pregnancy Loss: Any acute infection characterized by bacteremia, viremia, and/or high fever may precipitate pregnancy loss. Notable infections include Influenza, Rubella, Syphilis, Listeriosis, Chlamydia, and other bacterial and viral infections. Male Factor in Recurrent Pregnancy Loss: Recent research has established a correlation between male reproductive health and pregnancy loss. Conditions such as: \u2022 Varicocele \u2022 Sperm DNA fragmentation. Additionally, imbalances in seminal fluid composition may influence maternal immune responses to pregnancy. Moreover, balanced structural chromosomal aberrations in the father can result in unbalanced transmission to the fetus, leading to pregnancy loss. Risk Factors for Recurrent Pregnancy Loss: \u2022 Advanced parental age: The risk of spontaneous abortion increases when the mother is over 35 years old, and the father is over 40 years old. \u2022 Lifestyle factors: Tobacco use, alcohol, caffeine, and drug consumption are dose-dependent risk factors for pregnancy loss. \u2022 Obesity: Both maternal and paternal obesity are recognized as risk factors. \u2022 Stress is associated with RPL, but couples should be informed that there is no evidence that stress is a direct cause of pregnancy loss. Management and Prevention of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss: Women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss should not attempt conception until a definitive cause is identified and appropriately addressed. Comprehensive counseling and psychological support are crucial for couples experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss. Management of affected couples should be led by specialists using personalized medicine approaches within specialized medical institutions. It is essential to acknowledge that the challenge of pregnancy loss escalates with increasing spontaneous abortion rates. Timely diagnosis is fundamental to effective, targeted, and evidence-based treatment. Author: Elene Asanidze, Associate Professor, Obstetrician-Gynecologist, Doctor of Medicine",
            "ForPatients5Title": "The Role of Natural Killer Cells in Physiological and Pathological Pregnancy",
            "ForP5Paragraph1": "Since the early pregnancy, major adaptations occur in the maternal immune system to tolerate semi-allogeneic fetus (with 50% of foreign paternal antigens) from maternal immune attack, while actively protect it from different pathogens. This unique immunological dialogue between mother and fetus is recognized as an “Immunological paradox of pregnancy”. The fine balance of different immune cells at the maternal fetal interface is the prerequisite of successful pregnancy, while their disturbed number and proportions is associated with various complications of pregnancy. Natural killer (NK) cells are the key players of our innate immunity. They are in peripheral blood (pNK) and in uterus as well (uNK). They differ functionally and phenotypically. In endometrium they represent the most abundant population of leucocytes (≈70%). There are main subtypes of uNK cells: <br>🔹 Regulatory (pro-fertile) CD56+ uNK cells play pivotal role in normal processes of endometrial receptivity, implantation/placentation, development of adequate uterine vasculature, maintenance of immune homeostasis in endometrium and finally results in successful outcome of pregnancy. <br>🔹Cytotoxic CD16+ and CD57+ uNK- are cells with high cytotoxic potential. They contain big amount of cytotoxic granules (perforins, granzymes) and are responsible for lytic ability and cytotoxicity of NK cells. By the opinion of many researchers, this exact immunophenotype is involved in pathogenesis of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). The increased number and over-activation of cytotoxic uNK cells result in disturbed processes of endometrial receptivity, decidualization, development of non-adequate uterine vasculature. This finally leads to various complications of pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, spontaneous and recurrent pregnancy losses, recurrent implantation failure after IVF, as well as with infertility. Results of many studies indicate that endometrial immune disbalance is behind more than 50% of unexplained RPL. <br>Pre-conceptional immune diagnostics is of great importance in order to find out potential immunological causes of unexplained reproductive disorders and select specific subgroup of high-risk patients with RPL, which benefit more with tailored immunological treatments. Diagnostics of pNK cells in fresh blood is performed with Flow Cytometry, which gives the information about the number and activation status of different subtypes of NK and other immune cells. <br>Immunohistochemistry is used for the diagnostics of endometrial uNK cells which is regarded as gold standard to detect the number and localization of uNK cells across the whole endometrium. For this purpose, a small piece of endometrium (3 mm) is needed to be taken with pipelle catheter in mid-luteal phase of menstrual cycle. This is ambulatory procedure and does not need anesthesia. Results of investigations is evaluated by the expert, which is specialized in reproductive immunology. Infertility doctor is responsible for the individualized treatment and follow-up. Doctor gynecologist Maia Chiokadze conducted her doctoral research work in “Placenta Lab” University Hospital Jena, Germany (DAAD-Rustaveli joint fellowship in 2017, 2018 yy), where she also investigated a uterine biopsy sample of Georgian population under the supervision of renowned expert in reproductive immunology prof. Udo Markert. Currently we still continue scientific collaboration with our German colleagues and conduct new joint projects. <br>P +995 599211001 <br>Prof. Maia Chiokadze MD, PhD,",
