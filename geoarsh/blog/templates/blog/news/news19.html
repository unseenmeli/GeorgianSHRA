        On December 19, 2024, Dr. David Skhirtladze was awarded the degree of Doctor of Medicine by the Faculty of Medicine at Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University. His dissertation, “Efficacy of Combined Surgical and Hormonal Therapy for Infertile Patients with Deep Endometriosis,” was supervised by Professors Jenaro Kristesashvili and Ramaz Charekishvili.    </p>

    <p data-translation-key="news19Paragraph2">
        The dissertation aimed to determine the efficacy of combined surgical and hormonal therapy for infertile patients with deep endometriosis. The study found that combined surgical and hormonal therapy should be considered an effective treatment method for deep endometriosis-associated infertility, dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain. Importantly, even short-term use of dienogest may significantly improve pregnancy outcomes and provide effective relief of pelvic pain.    </p>
