        Thanks to the active academic involvement, scientific contributions, and clinical work of our members, our association is now officially on its way to becoming a member of the International Federation of the Societies of Gynecological Endocrinology (FISGE)
        FISGE brings together the world’s leading societies in gynecological endocrinology, united by a commitment to advancing research, education, and collaboration in all areas of women’s hormonal health.
        This international recognition not only honors the efforts of our Georgian professionals but also strengthens our opportunities for global cooperation, knowledge exchange, and progress in the field.
        We look forward to growing together with the international community and contributing meaningfully to the future of gynecological endocrinology!
