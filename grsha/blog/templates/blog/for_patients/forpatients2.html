        Intimate Hygiene for Girls: Essential Tips for Parents
    </h1>

    <p data-translation-key="ForP2Paragraph1">
        As parents, ensuring your little one’s intimate hygiene is key to their health and comfort. Follow these simple yet crucial recommendations to keep your child happy and healthy: During Bathing: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap before starting the hygiene routine. Always bathe your child from front to back, directing the water flow from the pubis to the tailbone to prevent infections. Use your hands instead of a sponge for gentle cleaning. Choose liquid, pH-neutral baby soap without fragrances or dyes. Use soap sparingly and avoid applying it to the inner surface of the labia to prevent irritation.

        Diapering & Drying: Change diapers every 3–4 hours and rinse your baby with water after each bowel movement. Avoid talcum powder—it can irritate the baby’s delicate skin. After your child turns 1 year old, consider limiting regular diaper use to promote healthy skin. Gently pat the genitals dry after bathing and wait until they’re completely dry before dressing your child.

        Clothing Tips: Choose breathable cotton underwear; synthetic materials can trap moisture and promote inflammation. Ensure the underwear fits comfortably and doesn’t press on the external genitalia. Special Note for Newborns: If you notice a white coating on your baby girl’s genitals, don’t worry! This natural protective barrier guards against infection. Do not remove it, it will disappear on its own with time. Why Proper Hygiene Matters: Good hygiene practices not only prevent irritation and infections but also instill lifelong habits for personal care. Start early, be gentle, and always consult a pediatric gynecologist if you have concerns. For expert advice, reach out to: Professor Elene Asanidze Obstetrician-Gynecologist, Pediatric Gynecologist
