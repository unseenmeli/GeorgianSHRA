The study explores androgen resistance syndrome, a rare condition affecting approximately 1 in 20,000 newborn males, and presents a comprehensive analysis of 41 individualsâ€”a dataset of notable significance for clinicians and researchers in the field. Given the complexity of gender assessment in cases of androgen resistance, this research offers valuable insights into its psychosexual implications and clinical evaluation.
